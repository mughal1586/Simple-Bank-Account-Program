Simple Bank Account Program

Description
This C++ program simulates a simple bank account, allowing users to check their balance, deposit, and withdraw funds.

Features
-   Initializes an account with a starting balance.
-   Allows users to view their current balance.
-   Provides functionality to deposit funds into the account.  Deposit amounts must be greater than 500.
-   Provides functionality to withdraw funds from the account. Withdrawal amounts must be greater than 500.
-   Displays appropriate messages for invalid input or insufficient funds.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function, which handles user interaction, displays the menu, and calls the appropriate functions to perform deposit or withdrawal operations. [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
-   `Account.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Account class methods (getters, setters, deposit, and withdraw). [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
-   `header.h`: Contains the declaration of the Account class. [cite: 19, 20]

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations. [cite: 19]
-   string: Not directly used, but included in the header. [cite: 19]

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, Account.cpp, header.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
